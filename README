To run:
1. mvn clean package
2. java -jar target/localstack-error-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The first run will launch the container and exit. A second run will hang attempting to launch the container. 

I am able to repro this on Docker For Mac 3.0.0+ running Docker Engine 20+

This does not repro on Docker For Mac 2.5.0.1 running Docker Engine 19
